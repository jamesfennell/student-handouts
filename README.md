## Abstract

The Student Handouts package, `studenthandouts`, is used to generate a single master
document that contains a set of individual student handouts.

The package has two main functions.

First, it provides a simple framework for organizing handout source code, and
supplies a set of import management tools for selectively importing a subset of the
handouts into the master document. Selective import is convenient when compilation
of all of the handouts is unnecessary, for example when working on a new handout.

As a secondary feature, the package defines a basic visual style for handouts. This
style can be easily changed.

For full documentation, see `studenthandouts-doc.pdf`.


## Installation
The `.sty` file itself is provided with the package and should be placed
in the appropriate directory in your Latex installation for use globally.

To use the package in just one project, save the `.sty` file in the same directory
as the handouts master document.
